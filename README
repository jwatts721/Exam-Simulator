The questions in the questions file should have the following format:

It is recommended NOT to set inclusions and exclusions of the same IDs at the same time. 

Image Naming Conventions
If there are images that are part of your question and answers, you should consider the following:
- If an image is displayed as part of the question, the image should be named as follows:
    <appPrefix><question.id>.jpg (or .png)

- If images are displayed as answers, the images should be named as follows:
    <appPrefix><question.id>_a.jpg (or .png)
    <appPrefix><question.id>_b.jpg
    <appPrefix><question.id>_c.jpg
